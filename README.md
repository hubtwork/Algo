#### Algorithm is not essential, but ultimately needed

In 1year+ work experience, I almost didn't care about algorithms.

But when i faced some performance issues, there was a limit to relying on just memory and googling.

So like TIL, I try to solve at least one problem every day and remember the algorithm steadily.
